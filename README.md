Manage development environment processes for the lazy

## What?
In short terms, this program allows you to control what processes are running on your OS while developing a project locally, this is useful when you have two or more projects that might have the same dependencies, and run on the same ports which forces you to disable one of them then enable it again when you want to work on it.

If your laziness is remotly close to mine, then this program might be useful for you.
